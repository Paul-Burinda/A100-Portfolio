<h2>About A100</h2>
	<div class='row'>
		<p class='large-12 column'>A100 is an Independent Software Initiative that trains individuals who have some background in web development to prepare them to work for a startup. We connect out Apprentices with local startup companies looking for talent. Why do we do this? Because we want to see CT's tech scene grow! It is a free 3 month program for Apprentices and at the end of the program we will connect you with local startup companies looking to hire interns. We have trainings on javascript, php, html/css, and agile software development. You will build projects in teams and use your knowledge in a practical, hands-on environment. </p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
	<div class='row'>
		<div class='large-6 column' id='faq-left'>
		<h4>How much does it cost?</h4>
		<p>The A100 program is free for Apprentices.</p>
		<h4>What is the time frame of the program? How much time should I expect to commit to the program?</h4>
		<p>A100 is a part-time three month program. You will be required to meet for one weekly training session and one weekly demo. Most of the work will be done with your teams and away from formal program time. Our Apprentices typically commit 10 hours a week to the program. </p>
		<h4>What is the application process?</h4>
		<p>The first step is to fill out an <a href="apply.php">application form.</a> Applicants choosen to move on in the process will be contacted by our program manager for an interview and a short coding test.</p>

		</div>
		<div class='large-6 column' id='faq-right'>
		<h4>What is the curriculum?</h4>
		<p>Our trainings and projects vary from cohort to cohort but you can expect to have trainings on Javascript, PHP, HTM5/CSS3, Git/Version Control, and agile software development. </p>
		<h4>What are the requirements to apply?</h4>
		<p>Anyone who is interested in the program can apply but we are looking for individuals with some background in web/software development since this is not a program for beginners. Most of our past Apprentices have been students in CS, EE, or similar fields, but we have also had some self-taught individuals without formal technical training. Applicants should be familiar with HTML/CSS, a backend language like Java, C+, PHP, or Python, and version control.  </p>
		<h4>Is this a coding bootcamp?</h4>
		<p>No, A100 is not a coding bootcamp. We are not a program for beginners but expect a certain understanding of web/software development. </p>
